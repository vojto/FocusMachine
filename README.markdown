# FoMa (Focus Machine)

Blocks all websites where you waste time - everything is blocked permanently.

You can request an exception for certain amount of time if you need to get something done on social networks, or you just need a break from focused state.

You set the timer (15minutes for example) and when it's up, you will be returned to the focused state.

## Tech stuff

You need to `chown [username] /etc/hosts` before using this.

## Why?

There is an excellent app called [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com), where you can block set of websites for some duration of time. The problem with this app is that **distracted is the default, permanent state** and **focused is temporary state**.

We think your mind should work the opposite. You should be focused by default, 24 hours a day. By focused we don't mean "concentrating", more like "calm". You have to practice this calmness 24 hours a day to become a calm, focused person.

The social networks out there are just killing our minds. Distracted has become the default state of mind. Checking Instagram stories that you don't care about ten times a day.

## Give up your phone

It's not gonna work if you keep social media apps on your phone. Delete everything where you can go and "check" to see what's new. Disable Safari through parental controls, so it doesn't tempt you to use web version. If this is too hard for you, ask a friend to create a parental controls passcode for you, then disable installing new apps.

## Planned features
